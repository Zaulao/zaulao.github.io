This will be a series of posts updated with each major change or novelty as this project progresses.

Since I started working with information security a few years ago and, consequently, with IT infrastructure, I've planned to build a home lab to host some little personal projects, test out some applications and other shenanigans. I now believe that the time has come to get this project off the ground.

# The Hardware

As this is my first activity of its kind, I decided to start simple. You see, I have a limited physical space and budget, which means I can't afford to have a big rack with dedicated equipment (yet). With this in mind, I enumerated a few options: use an old cabinet computer hidden somewhere in the house, build a small rack with smaller equipment and camouflage it among the living room furniture, or buy a mini pc. I chose the third one.

The equipment used will be a Beelink Mini S12 Pro with a 12th generation Intel N95 processor, 8 Gigs of DDR4 RAM memory and 256 Gigs of M.2 NVMe SSD storage. It was purchased on [AliExpress](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005005200158913.html) just under a month ago. I'm waiting for delivery by the local Postal service, which should happen later this month (I hope).

# The Software

As the ad description highlights, the computer comes with Windows 11 pre-installed. To suit my needs, I'm going to dump this installation and put a Linux version in its place. I still haven't decided which distro exactly to use, but I imagine I have two more obvious options: A simple Debian/Ubuntu server or some hypervisor-focused distro (like proxmox). Anyway, I already have in mind that most of the applications executed will be container deployments (probably through docker compose).

Until I get my hands on this machine, that's all I have to say. See you soon.
